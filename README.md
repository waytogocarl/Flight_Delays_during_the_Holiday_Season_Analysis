Flight Delays during the Holiday Season (Nov.-Dec. 2021-2023)

With a group consisting of myself and 4 of my colleagues we analyzed flight delay data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics to identify causes of delays and evaluate the performance of airline carriers during the holiday season from November to December 2021-2023. As a group we conducted a statistical analysis and created visualizations to answer key questions regarding flight delays, including relationships between delays and various factors such as weather and airline carrier performance.

We pulled our data from Bureau of Transportation Statistics on Airline On-Time Performance and Causes of Flight Delays.


Questions we answered:
- What are the various causes of delays: Air Carrier, Extreme Weather, National Aviation System (NAS), Late-arriving aircraft, and Security

- What are the Top Five Airlines with the Most Delays due to Airline Carrier?

- Which airline carriers have the most/least Weather Related Delays in Hours, By Airline and Months?

- What is the Relationship between Flight Cancellation and Weather Delays in the Month of Dec. 2023?

- Which airline carriers have the lowest/highest # of Delays due to Airline Carrier?

- What is the relationship between Airline Carrier and the Number of Delays due to Late Aircrafts?

- What are the Average Number of Delays due to the National Aviation System for the Top Three Airlines in the USA?
